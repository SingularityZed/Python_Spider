> Small python script to set the Bing Image of the Day as your GNOME lock screen 

## Have you ever been tired of the same lock screen all the day?
## Have you ever dreamed of having a Windows Spotlight lock screen on your GNOME desktop?
## That's why this project has been started.
## There already exists a similar and better project https://github.com/neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension but it's a great practice for me to make my own　using python. So, I insist on making this project better.

## Features
* change your GNOME lock screen pictures daily with Bing Image of the day
* the pictures are stored at ~/Pictures/Bing/
* delete pictures more than 7 days 
  
## Usage
clone this repo and add python3 bing_screen_saver.py to start up applications
